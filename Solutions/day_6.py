# Question 18

# A website requires the users to input username and password to register. Write a program to check the validity of password input by users.

# Following are the criteria for checking the password:

# At least 1 letter between [a-z]
# At least 1 number between [0-9]
# At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
# At least 1 character from [$#@]
# Minimum length of transaction password: 6
# Maximum length of transaction password: 12

# Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will check them according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed, each separated by a comma.

# Example

# If the following passwords are given as input to the program:

# ABd1234@1,a F1#,2w3E*,2We3345

# Then, the output of the program should be:

# ABd1234@1

import re
a = input('Enter passwords: ').split(',')
pass_pattern = re.compile(
    r"^(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[$#@]).{6,12}$")
for i in a:
    if pass_pattern.fullmatch(i):
        print(i)

# Question 19

# You are required to write a program to sort the (name, age, score) tuples by ascending order where name is string, age and score are numbers. The tuples are input by console. The sort criteria is:

# 1: Sort based on name
# 2: Then sort based on age
# 3: Then sort by score

# The priority is that name age score.

# If the following tuples are given as input to the program:

# Tom,19,80
# John,20,90
# Jony,17,91
# Jony,17,93
# Json,21,85

# Then, the output of the program should be:

# [('John', '20', '90'), ('Jony', '17', '91'), ('Jony', '17', '93'), ('Json', '21', '85'), ('Tom', '19', '80')]

lst = []
while True:
    s = input().split(',')
    if not s[0]:                          # breaks for blank input
        break
    lst.append(tuple(s))

# here key is defined by lambda and the data is sorted by element priority 0>1>2 in accending order
lst.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], int(x[1]), int(x[2])))
print(lst)
